🔁 Redoing the KIT from the Beginning
We'll structure your system into its three main engines:

1. Oracle (Forecast Intelligence Engine)
Inputs: DOB, TOB, POB, Forecast Dates

Process: Compute planetary overlays using Skyfield

Output: JSON with positions and astrology overlay data

Purpose Usage for Astrology Overlay:  
Astrology Timing Includes:
2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th Houses

Jupiter / Saturn transits

North Node guidance

Moon phase activations

Red / Yellow / Green Timing Days


2. Scribe (Narrative Generator)
Inputs: JSON from Oracle

Process: Interpret astrological positions into narrative insights

Output: Written forecast report (text or PDF)

3. Sentinel (User Interface & Trigger System)
Inputs: User selection or schedule

Process: Run scripts, show output, trigger forecasts

Output: Interface or automation for report generation

⚙️ How to Run It: Manual or Command Line?
You can do both — but here’s the breakdown:

Method	When to Use	Tools Involved
Command Prompt (Manual CLI)	For full control, testing individual parts, scripting automation	Run python run_oracle.py, run_scribe.py, etc.
Oracle, Scribe & Sentinel (Full Pipeline)	Once you’ve modularized everything	Run a master script or GUI (main.py) to trigger the full flow
