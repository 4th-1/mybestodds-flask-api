🔵 SCRIBE v3.7 – REQUIRED COLUMN SCHEMA (Updated)

SCRIBE must validate that every forecast.csv contains these columns.
Nothing else is required. Anything not listed here is allowed but not required.

SCRIBE must mark a row “missing_required” only if any of these columns are missing:

IDENTITY (Required)

kit_name

game_code

forecast_date

draw_time

number

OVERLAY (Required)

overlay_score

(Note: In v3.7 all other overlay components — moon, zodiac, numerology, planetary — are now internal only. They are NOT required in the forecast.csv.)

RUBIK (Required)

play_type

play_type_rubix

rubik_code

rubik_bucket

CONFIDENCE (Required)

confidence_score

confidence_band

confidence_pct

MBO ODDS (Required)

mbo_odds

mbo_odds_text

mbo_odds_band

BOB (Required)

bob_action

bob_note

WLS (Required)

wls
(Important: wls_rank is NO LONGER required. Remove it from expected columns.)

HITLOG (Required)

hit_type_book

hit_type_book3

hit_type_bosk

MISC (Required)

sum

sum_range

priority

lane

delta_pattern

(All other MISC fields such as posterior, markov, kelly, ML score are now optional or deprecated.)

🔶 SCRIBE must treat ALL OTHER COLUMNS as optional

If any column appears in the CSV that is not listed above, SCRIBE should treat it as:

Unexpected but allowed
(not an error)

🔥 Scribe’s job after the update

After pasting the above rules, SCRIBE will:

✔ Only flag true missing-required columns
✔ Stop flagging wls_rank as missing
✔ Stop flagging old overlay fields as missing
✔ Stop flagging ML/WLS/Markov/Kelly/Posteriors as missing
✔ Pass your new v3.7 kits cleanly
✔ Give accurate alignment and schema pass/fail reports
✔ Eliminate all false positives across all output folders
